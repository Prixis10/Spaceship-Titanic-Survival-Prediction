# 🚀 Spaceship-Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Predicting spaceship passenger survival using machine learning with comprehensive data analysis, cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.

## Overview 📜

This repository contains my solutions and analyses for the Kaggle competition ["Spaceship Titanic"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic). The goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the spaceship using various machine learning techniques. This project was undertaken during my introduction to machine learning.

## Project Overview 🧩

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization 🔍

- Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- Visualize important features to identify patterns and relationships that might influence survival rates.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering 🔧

- Clean the data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
- Engineer new features and transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
- Normalize and scale features as necessary.

### 3. Model Building and Evaluation 🤖

- Implemented a RandomForestClassifier model.
- Evaluated the model using cross-validation and various performance metrics.
- Fine-tuned the model parameters to optimize performance.

### 4. Submission 📤

- Generated predictions for the test dataset using the trained RandomForestClassifier model.
- Formatted the predictions according to Kaggle’s submission requirements.
- Submitted the results to Kaggle and reviewed the leaderboard position.
